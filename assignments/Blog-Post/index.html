      <h1><center>The Johnny Deep-Amber Heard Trial Explained</center></h1>
      <p>
        After six weeks, the contentious defamation trial between actors and
        former spouses Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is set to wrap up with
        closing arguments scheduled for Friday morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depp filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife over a 2018 op-ed she wrote in
        The Washington Post, in which she referred to herself as a public figure
        representing domestic abuse. Depp, seeking $50 million, claims that even
        though Heard did not name him, the piece damaged his reputation and
        career because she was referring to the period two years prior, when she
        filed for divorce and a restraining order; Depp has denied all claims of
        abuse. Heard then countersued Depp for $100 million after his lawyer
        said her allegations were false in three statements in the press.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trial is being held in the Fairfax County Courthouse, since The
        Post’s servers and printing presses are in Fairfax County. The Post is
        not a defendant in the case. The trial also comes after Depp lost a
        libel case in 2020 in which he sued the British tabloid the Sun, and its
        executive editor, Dan Wootton, for publishing a story referring to Depp
        as a “wife beater.”

        <h2><a id="article_1">What did Depp testify?</a></h2>
        <p>
          Depp was on the stand for two days in April, and said he was there
          because of Heard’s “heinous” and “disturbing” allegations of abuse and
          that he wanted everyone to know the claims were “not based in any
          species of truth.” Though Depp acknowledged there were arguments
          between them, he testified, “Never did I, myself, reach the point of
          striking Ms. Heard in any way, nor have I ever struck any woman in my
          life.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor said Heard seemed like the “perfect partner” for the first
          year to 18 months of their relationship, but then things started to
          change. They started having long and winding arguments, Depp said.
          Although he admitted to alcohol and drug use, he said that Heard has
          “grossly embellished” his “quote-unquote substance abuse.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor said that after Heard’s op-ed was published, his reputation
          was ruined and he lost out on roles, including being dropped by Disney
          from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="article_2">What did Heard testify?</a></h2>
        <p>
          According to Heard, Depp resumed a lifestyle of heavy drinking and
          drug use. In graphic detail, an often teary Heard chronicled multiple
          incidents of physical and sexual abuse from Depp. She painted him as
          jealous and controlling, often demanding she take roles that didn’t
          include sex or romance. She said he regularly hit her — adding that on
          more than one occasion, she feared for her life. During one fight, she
          testified, he sexually assaulted her with a liquor bottle.
        </p>
        <p>
          During her testimony, the defense entered several photos showing an
          injured Heard into evidence, along with expletive-laden emails and
          text messages between the couple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Heard said the op-ed she wrote isn’t about Depp; it’s about
          what happened to her after she obtained a temporary restraining order
          against the actor.

        <p>
          Anyone watching the trial probably noted the many objections made by
          both sides. Jamie R. Abrams, a law professor with the University of
          Louisville, helped break down some of the most common ones we’ve seen.
