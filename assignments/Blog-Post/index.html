      <h1><center>The Johnny Deep-Amber Heard Trial Explained</center></h1>
      <p>
        After six weeks, the contentious defamation trial between actors and
        former spouses Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is set to wrap up with
        closing arguments scheduled for Friday morning.

        Depp filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife over a 2018 op-ed she wrote in
        The Washington Post, in which she referred to herself as a public figure
        representing domestic abuse. Depp, seeking $50 million, claims that even
        though Heard did not name him, the piece damaged his reputation and
        career because she was referring to the period two years prior, when she
        filed for divorce and a restraining order; Depp has denied all claims of
        abuse. Heard then countersued Depp for $100 million after his lawyer
        said her allegations were false in three statements in the press.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trial is being held in the Fairfax County Courthouse, since The
        Post’s servers and printing presses are in Fairfax County. The Post is
        not a defendant in the case. The trial also comes after Depp lost a
        libel case in 2020 in which he sued the British tabloid the Sun, and its
        executive editor, Dan Wootton, for publishing a story referring to Depp
        as a “wife beater.”

                Depp was on the stand for two days in April, and said he was
                there because of Heard’s “heinous” and “disturbing” allegations
                of abuse and that he wanted everyone to know the claims were
                “not based in any species of truth.” Though Depp acknowledged
                there were arguments between them, he testified, “Never did I,
                myself, reach the point of striking Ms. Heard in any way, nor
                have I ever struck any woman in my life.”

                The actor said Heard seemed like the “perfect partner” for the
                first year to 18 months of their relationship, but then things
                started to change. They started having long and winding
                arguments, Depp said. Although he admitted to alcohol and drug
                use, he said that Heard has “grossly embellished” his
                “quote-unquote substance abuse.”

                dropped by Disney from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

            Heard lawyer Ben Rottenborn repeatedly made the point that Depp is
            suing Heard specifically over the op-ed, and noted that Heard never
            named Depp and it didn’t contain any details of their time together.
            Using texts and audio recordings, Rottenborn pushed back on Depp’s
            version of events when Heard alleged he abused her. He argued that
            Depp’s alcohol and drug use were what cost him his career.

                According to Heard, Depp resumed a lifestyle of heavy drinking
                and drug use. In graphic detail, an often teary Heard chronicled
                multiple incidents of physical and sexual abuse from Depp. She
                painted him as jealous and controlling, often demanding she take
                roles that didn’t include sex or romance. She said he regularly
                hit her — adding that on more than one occasion, she feared for
                her life. During one fight, she testified, he sexually assaulted
                her with a liquor bottle.

                During her testimony, the defense entered several photos showing

                emails and text messages between the couple.

                Finally, Heard said the op-ed she wrote isn’t about Depp; it’s
                about what happened to her after she obtained a temporary
                restraining order against the actor.

            Depp attorney Camille Vasquez attempted to discredit Heard’s
            testimony with rapid-fire questions. Vasquez pointed to the lack of
            medical records backing up Heard’s testimony, noting that Heard
            continued using drugs and alcohol herself while expressing concern
            about Depp’s substance abuse. She pressed heavily against Heard’s
            argument that the op-ed at the center of the case isn’t about Depp.

        <p>
          Anyone watching the trial probably noted the many objections made by
          both sides. Jamie R. Abrams, a law professor with the University of
          Louisville, helped break down some of the most common ones we’ve seen.

            A witness “should generally only be giving testimony directly to the
            jury under oath,” says Abrams. While they can testify to events that
            occurred, they “should not be recounting conversations about those
            events to prove the events themselves.” In other words, Abrams says,
            “Witness A can describe to the jurors how B hit them and even the
            action of calling C afterward, but the jurors should not generally
            hear A say ‘I told C that B did these things’ for the purpose of
            proving the truth of what B did.” That’s why it seems like witnesses
            cannot recount conversations they previously had outside of court.

          <p>
            Often, witnesses are describing events. If they get ahead of
            themselves without establishing basic context such as “where the
            witness was during the event or how they knew the people involved,
            that would lack foundation for the jurors,” says Abrams. “This
            happens a lot because the witnesses are so well-prepared and they
            know what their most important points are."

          <p>
            “This case is a defamation suit, so the testimony is limited to the
            truth or falsity of just a few very specific published statements
            and the damages those statements may have caused,” says Abrams.
            Anything not “relevant to proving the elements of just these
            defamation claims” is considered beyond the scope of the trial and
            thus cannot be entered into evidence.
